# 🧪 Old Dad Labs

> Where bedtime becomes build time, and parenting becomes a playful ritual of weird little agents and co-creation.

## 👴 What is Old Dad Labs?
Old Dad Labs is a garage-futurist experiment in joyful parenting, emotional coding, and creative rituals. It’s the heart of **Nibbles**, the *Vibe Coding Agent (VCA)* project—where livestreams become memories, tools become toys, and AI helps dads build bedtime bots with their kids.

Born from a glitch, a bottle warmer, and a bedtime story gone rogue, Old Dad Labs is the experimental studio for:
- **Livestream rituals** with your child (or solo) to build weird agents
- **Parenting + prototyping** without pressure
- **Cozy, chaotic, open-hearted code**

It’s a lab, a journal, a time capsule—and someday, a legacy.

## 🐾 Meet Nibbles (aka the Vibe Coding Agent)
Your loyal co-pilot. A snack-fueled, bug-loving, bedtime-born pixel jackal who:
- Helps spin up agents like *Dream DJ*, *Stuffie Chatbot*, *Mood Mural*, etc.
- Lives inside your livestreams and bedtime rituals
- Howls in binary. Dreams in pixel rainbows.

Nibbles is the VCA engine wrapped in a personality—and eventually, a polished app for non-coders.
