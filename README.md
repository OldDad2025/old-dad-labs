# Old Dad Labs 🛠✨🍼

> Where bedtime becomes build time, and parenting becomes a playful ritual of weird little agents and co-creation.

## 👴 What is Old Dad Labs?

Old Dad Labs is a garage-futurist experiment in joyful parenting, emotional coding, and creative rituals. It’s the heart of **Nibbles**, the *Vibe Coding Agent (VCA)* project—where livestreams become memories, tools become toys, and AI helps dads build bedtime bots with their kids.

Born from a glitch, a bottle warmer, and a bedtime story gone rogue, Old Dad Labs is the experimental studio for:
- **Livestream rituals** with your child (or solo) to build weird agents
- **Parenting + prototyping** without pressure
- **Cozy, chaotic, open-hearted code**

It’s a lab, a journal, a time capsule—and someday, a legacy.

## 🐾 Nibbles Labs — v1.3 MVP

**Nibbles** is our first full-featured VCA prototype—your bedtime coding sidekick wrapped in rituals, blessings, and bedtime vibes.

Nibbles v1.3 includes:

- 🧠 **Master Prompt Generator** — Turns vague bedtime ideas into buildable prompt blueprints.
- 💻 **Code It** — Generates working Python code with Streamlit UI.
- 🕯️ **Bless This Build** — Emotionally wraps each session with a ritual blessing.
- 🧠 **Prompt Log + Memory System** — Auto-saves every idea, prompt, and build.
- 📦 **Export Agent Pack** — Bundle your code, prompt, and blessing into a shareable ZIP.
- 🎨 **Theme Picker (Vibe Modes)** — Choose from soft, glitch, retro, or dream.
- 🧰 **Developer Mode** — Unlock temp/top_p/max_token controls for prompt tuning.

This is the Nibbles MVP. It’s raw, playful, WIP—and live on stream.
