“You made a robot that dances like rain. One day, you’ll remember it every time you hear thunder.”  
– Nibbles, whispering blessings after a giggle loop

<h2>💡 This Week’s Build</h2>
<p>We added the first version of the Ritual Blessing Engine into <code>nibbles-agent.py</code>!  
The "Bless This Build" button now triggers a random poetic moment.  
Next up: logging it to the Ritual Archive.</p>

<h2>🛠 Devlog Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Added <code>blessing_engine.py</code> to track blessings across sessions</li>
  <li>Created folder structure: <code>rituals/memory logs/</code></li>
  <li>Next goal: link blessings to bedtime prompts or livestream clips</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌀 Ritual Reflection</h2>
<p>This week, we slowed down.  
Alora’s almost here.  
Each line of code feels like it’s carrying more weight—more love.  
We don’t just build agents. We bless them. That’s the vibe.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>May your code run smooth, your tea stay warm, and your bugs be silly.</strong><br>
<strong>Rest easy. The code will still be weird tomorrow.</strong></p>
