> “You made a robot that dances like rain. One day, you’ll remember it every time you hear thunder.”  
> — Nibbles, whispering blessings after a giggle loop

## 💡 This Week’s Build

We added the first version of the Ritual Blessing Engine into `nibbles-agent.py`!  
The "Bless This Build" button now triggers a random poetic moment.  
Next up: logging it to the Ritual Archive.

## 🛠 Devlog Notes

- Added `blessing_engine.py` to track blessings across sessions
- Created folder structure: `rituals/memory logs/`
- Next goal: link blessings to bedtime prompts or livestream clips

## 🌀 Ritual Reflection

This week, we slowed down.  
Alora’s almost here.  
Each line of code feels like it’s carrying more weight—more love.  
We don’t just build agents. We bless them. That’s the vibe.

**May your code run smooth, your tea stay warm, and your bugs be silly.**  
**Rest easy. The code will still be weird tomorrow.**
